      JSON
===============

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. 
It is a format for structuring data. 
This format is used by different web applications to communicate with each other. 
It is the replacement of the XML data exchange format. 
It is easy to struct the data compare to XML. 
It supports data structures like arrays and objects and the JSON documents that are rapidly executed on the server.

Why JSON?
     It is a Language-Independent format that is derived from JavaScript. 
     It is Human-readable and writable. 
     It is a lightweight text-based data interchange format which means, it is simpler to read and write when compared to XML. 
     Though it is derived from a subset of JavaScript, yet it is Language independent. 
     Thus, the code for generating and parsing JSON data can be written in any other programming language.

     Syntax Rules: Data is in name/value pairs and they are separated by commas. 
     It uses curly brackets to hold the objects and square brackets to hold the arrays.
