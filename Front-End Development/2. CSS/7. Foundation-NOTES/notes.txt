=================

A Foundation is an open-source and responsive front-end framework created by ZURB in September 2011 that makes it simple to create stunning responsive websites, apps, and emails that operate on any device. 
Many companies, like Facebook, eBay, Mozilla, Adobe, and even Disney, use it.

The framework is based on bootstrap, which is similar to SaaS. It’s more complex, versatile, and configurable. 
It also comes with a command-line interface, making it simple to use with module bundlers. 
Email framework provides you with responsive HTML emails, which can be read on any device.
