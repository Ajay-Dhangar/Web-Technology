Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. 
It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. 
Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). 
All thanks to Bootstrap developers – Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.
